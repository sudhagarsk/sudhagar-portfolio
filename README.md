Navbar

Make sure the links in the navbar, such as "Home," "About," and "Projects," are fully functional, directing users to the right sections with smooth scrolling.

Styling Consistency

For consistency, try using the same margin and padding for all sections, ensuring everything is aligned uniformly. Consider setting a consistent color scheme across all sections to maintain a professional look. Images and Alt Text

Some images like the "Banner Image" in the home section or project images may need higher resolution to avoid pixelation. Ensure the alt attributes of your images are descriptive for accessibility purposes.

Skills Section

Consider changing the color or background of the progress bars for better contrast. You can add some hover effects to the skill icons to enhance interactivity.

YouTube Section

In the "Introduce Myself" section, you might want to increase the width of the embedded video on larger screens or add a media query to adjust it for smaller devices.

Project Section

Add real preview images instead of the same GIF for all projects. This will make each project distinct and visually engaging. Adding a brief description under each project title would give visitors a better understanding of what each project entails.

AOS Library

Make sure the AOS animations are responsive. Test on various screen sizes to ensure animations do not cause layout shifts or performance issues.

Feauture development Feature Idea: Create a more interactive project gallery using modals, carousels, or lightboxes to showcase your work. Instead of just linking to external projects, allow users to explore a project's details without leaving the page. How: You can use Bootstrap modals or a custom lightbox effect using JavaScript to display larger versions of images, project descriptions, or even video demonstrations.
